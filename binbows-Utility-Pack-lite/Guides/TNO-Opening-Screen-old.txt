	DO NOT USE!!!!!!
	THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE NEW TNO OPENING SCREEN INTRODUCED WITH TNO:UB.
	HOW EVER THE STEPS ARE STILL SIMILAR, THOUGH REQUIRING CHANGED TO ON_ACTIONS. SPECIFICALLY THE COUNTRY SET-UP ON_ACTIONS

#################LOCALISTAION#################


1.) Let's start with the basics, the Localistion.
First create a scripted_localization folder in your common folder.

2.) Grab the scripted localization file, named TNO_opening_Screen_scripted_loc.txt, from the main TNO mod.
Usually found in: X:\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\394360\2438003901\common\scripted_localisation or where ever you have TNO installed.
Also, remember to copy over to your mod folder, otherwise your overwriting main TNO files. ALWAYS EDIT COPIED FILES OR YOUR OWN! PROBLEMS WILL HAPPEN IF YOU EDIT BASE TNO!

Note; Making your own scripted localization file might work, however i'd recommend sticking with the main one.
Though it does make updating slightly more annoying if the TNO devs add new opening screens, since you're not working off of your own one.

3.) Now opening the file might be a bit overwhelming at first, but it's going to make sense soon enough.
At the top of the file you will see the defined_text with the name of "GET_CLOSEBUTTON_TEXT" with the localization strings beneath it.
This is where you will be storing your localization strings. 

4.) Copy one of the text containers and replace the tag with your own. The position of the text container does not matter unless it is outside of the defined_text container, Always keep it inside!
Now to get the text displaying, replace the localization key with your own.

Example :

text = {
	trigger = { tag = SWE }
	localization_key = TNO_OPENING_SCREEN_BUTTON_TEXT_SWE
}

5.) Create the localization file where you will store your text strings.
This should be very simple. Just copy the localization key you've created into the .yml file and do localization normally.
(Note; Make sure that the .yml file is valid for HOI4, otherwise it won't work.)

Example : 

TNO_OPENING_SCREEN_BUTTON_TEXT_SWE:0 "FramÃ¥t!"



6.) Now for the actual localization, the main text.
Similar as before. Though lower down in the scripted_localization file. 
Look for the defined_text called GET_COUNTRY_INFO

7.) Pick a simple one and copy it. (Not Komi, US or Germany, these have multi page text screens.)
Change the TAG and localization key. Done.

Example : 
	text = {
		trigger = { tag = SWE }
		localization_key = COUNTRY_INFO_SWEDEN
	}

8.) Now you've done the localization part! Great for you, however this does not cover multi page localization screens. i dunno how to do that tbh.



#################OPENING SCREEN ART#################

1.) Incredibly similar as before, however we're dealing with GFX files now instead of localization files.

2.) Keep the scripted localization file open.
Look for the defined_text named "GET_POSTER".
Copy a text container. Change Tag and Localization Key. Remember, Keep the Text Container within the defined_text!

Example :
	text = {
		trigger = { tag = SWE }
		localization_key = "GFX_TNO_OpeningScreen_Poster_Sweden"
	}

3.) Now, take your localization key put it in a .gfx file, format it normally, add your poster file.

Example : 

	spriteType = {
		name = "GFX_TNO_OpeningScreen_Poster_Sweden"
		textureFile = "gfx/interface/opening_screen/TNO_OpeningScreen_Poster_Sweden.dds"
	}

4.) Profit! You've done it. Now you have your own opening screen.
