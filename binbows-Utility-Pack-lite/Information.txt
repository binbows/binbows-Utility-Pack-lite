Hello! This is the lite version of the binbows Utility Pack, a collection of guides, assets and frames.
This pack contains items from which I have picked up from several discords. Mainly the TNO Sub-Modding Coop and the TNO Submod Cooperative and some from the #party-approved-media Channel in the TNO Discord

All Assets labled under the Assets folder has been created by myself, binbows#9857. I do not take credit for any other file/asset included in the pack!
Frames have been constructed with the Spuddatomic and Rusty frame packs.
